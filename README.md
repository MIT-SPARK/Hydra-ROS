## Hydra-ROS

This repository contains the ROS interface for [Hydra](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra) and is based on the following papers:
  - ["Hydra: A Real-time Spatial Perception System for 3D Scene Graph Construction and Optimization"](http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss18/p050.pdf)
  - ["Foundations of Spatial Perception for Robotics: Hierarchical Representations and Real-time Systems"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241229725)

### Getting started

Hydra has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic. See [here](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-running) to get started with Hydra.

### Running Hydra

See our documentation [here](doc/quickstart.md).

### Filing Issues

:warning: We don't support other platforms. Issues requesting support on other platforms (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04, Windows) will be summarily closed.

Depending on the nature of the issue, it may be helpful to browse [this](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Hydra/blob/main/doc/debugging.md) page about debugging Hydra first.
